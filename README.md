# RL-based-precoder-design-in-a-2-2-MIMO-OFDM-system-with-256-QAM-modulation.

This repository implements a **reinforcement learning (RL)** approach to select a precoder matrix in a **2Ã—2 MIMO-OFDM** system with **256-QAM** modulation. The simulation runs on GPU using **CuPy**, and the RL agent is trained using **PPO** from **stable-baselines3**.
